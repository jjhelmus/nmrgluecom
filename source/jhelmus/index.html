    <p>
    I am a scientist and software engineer at 
    <a href="http://www.anl.gov">Argonne National Laboratory</a>
    in the 
    <a href=http://www.evs.anl.gov>environmental science division.</a> 
    My research focuses on designing and implementing algorithms for 
    correcting, processing and analyzing data from weather radar.  
    In addition, I develop software for the 
    <a href="http://www.arm.gov">Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility</a>;
    a U.S. Department of Energy program that operates suites of
    instruments at fixed sites and mobile facilities across the globe in its mission
    to improve the understanding of earth system models and climate.  
    Much of this work focuses on writing software to process the data 
    collected by ARMâ€™s scanning cloud and precipitation radars
    as well as other ARM instruments. 
    To this end, I am the lead developer of the 
    <a href="https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart/">Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART)</a>,
    an open source toolkit for the analysis and manipulation of weather radar data.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am also a frequent contributor to a number of open source packages in
    the PyData/Scientific Python ecosystem.  This includes being a core member
    of <a href="https://conda-forge.github.io/">conda-forge</a> as well as the
    author of <a href="https://github.com/jjhelmus/pyfive">pyfive</a> and
    <a href="http://www.nmrglue.com/">nmrglue</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    I received my Ph.D. at the
    <a href="http://www.osu.edu">Ohio State University</a> in the 
    <a href="http://spectroscopy.mps.ohio-state.edu/chemphys/">Chemical Physics</a>
    department. My <a href="http://chemistry.osu.edu/~jaroniec/">research</a> 
    was focused on using solid state NMR to study biological solids under the guidance of 
    <a href="http://chemistry.osu.edu/faculty/jaroniec">Christopher Jaroniec</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    After Ohio State, I conducted postdoctoral reasearch with
    <a href="http://facultydirectory.uchc.edu/profile?profileId=hoch-jeffrey#tabs-4">Jeffrey Hoch</a>
    at the
    <a href="http://www.uchc.edu">University of Connecticut Heath Center </a>
    developing advanced methods for processing NMR data.

    <p>
    I am a scientist and software engineer at 
    <a href="http://www.anl.gov">Argonne National Laboratory</a>
    in the 
    <a href=http://www.evs.anl.gov>environmental science division.</a> 
    My research focuses on designing and implementing algorithms for 
    correcting, processing and analyzing data from weather radar.  
    In addition, I develop software for the 
    <a href="http://www.arm.gov">Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility</a>;
    a U.S. Department of Energy program that operates suites of
    instruments at fixed sites and mobile facilities across the globe in its mission
    to improve the understanding of earth system models and climate.  
    Much of this work focuses on writing software to process the data 
    collected by ARMâ€™s scanning cloud and precipitation radars
    as well as other ARM instruments. 
    To this end, I am the lead developer of the 
    <a href="https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart/">Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART)</a>,
    an open source toolkit for the analysis and manipulation of weather radar data.

    Previously, I completed a postdoctoral position at the 
    <a href="http://www.uchc.edu">University of Connecticut Heath Center </a> 
    in the department of 
    <a href="http://microbiology.uchc.edu/">Molecular, Microbial and Structural Biology.</a> 
    My research with 
    <a href="http://facultydirectory.uchc.edu/profile?profileId=hoch-jeffrey#tabs-4"> Dr. Jeffrey C. Hoch</a> 
    involved the development of advanced methods for processing NMR data.
    In addition, I was involved in upkeep and improvements to the 
    <a href="http://rnmrtk.uchc.edu/rnmrtk/RNMRTK.html">Rowland NMR Toolkit</a>, 
    a software package for processing multidimensional NMR data.
    </p>

    <p>
    I received my Ph.D. at the
    <a href="http://www.osu.edu">Ohio State University</a> in the 
    <a href="http://spectroscopy.mps.ohio-state.edu/chemphys/">Chemical Physics</a>
    department. My <a href="http://chemistry.osu.edu/~jaroniec/">research</a> 
    was focused on using solid state NMR to study biological solids under the guidance of 
    <a href="http://chemistry.osu.edu/faculty/jaroniec">Christopher Jaroniec</a>.
    </p>  

    <p>
    I am also the author of 
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nmrglue/">nmrglue</a>, 
    an open source module for working with NMR data in the 
    <a href="http://www.python.org">Python programming language.</a> 
    I am also both a user and contributor to a number of other 
    <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">Scientific Python modules.</a>

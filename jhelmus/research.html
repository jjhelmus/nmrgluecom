<h2>Research Experience</h2>
<br />

<h3><a href="http://anl.gov">Argonne National Laboratory</a>, Argonne, Illinois</h3>
<p><b>January 2013-Present</b><br />


I am working in the 
<a href="http://www.evs.anl.gov/">environmental science division</a>
at 
<a href="http://www.anl.gov/">Argonne National Laboratory</a> 
as a scientist and software engineer for the 
<a href="http://www.arm.gov">Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility.</a>
I am involved in a number of projects within ARM with other scientists 
and developers to create and release 
<a href="http://www.arm.gov/data/vaps">value added products</a>
from data collected by ARMâ€™s scanning precipitation and cloud radars. 
This work is highly collaborative with frequent input and interactions 
with scientists from universities and research centers across the globe.  

In addition, I am the lead developer of the 
<a href="https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart/">Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART)</a>,
an open source toolkit for the analysis and manipulation of weather radar data.  
My research focus is to design and implement algorithms to 
correct, process, and analyze data from weather radars within this framework.
</p>

<h3><a href="http://uchc.edu">UConn Health Center</a>, Farmington, Connecticut</h3>
<p><b>July 2011-January 2013</b><br />
I completed a post-doc in the lab of Dr. Jeffrey C. Hoch where I worked on a number of projects focusing
on using modern signal processing methods to process NMR data. These projects include maintaining and 
updating the <a href="http://rnmrtk.uchc.edu/rnmrtk/RNMRTK.html">Rowland NMR Toolkit</a>, a software
package for processing NMR data written primarily in FORTRAN 77 and C. 
In addition, I developed the software needed for my research into the effects of deconvolution 
kernels on NMR spectra processed using Maximum Entropy and l<sub>1</sub>-norm 
(compressive sensing) reconstruction methods. 
</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.osu.edu">The Ohio State University</a>, Columbus, Ohio</h3> 
<p><b>June 2005-July 2011</b><br />
While performing research for my doctoral thesis, I worked on a 500 MHz Varian (Agilent) NMR 
spectrometer equipped with multiple probes for magic angle spinning (MAS) of solid samples.  
I shared responsibility for the upkeep of the magnet with other graduate students including 
performing nitrogen and helium cryogen fills and troubleshooting hardware and software problems.
I wrote a number of pulse sequences for the spectrometer, as well as numerous scripts and 
software programs for automated processing and analysis of solid state NMR data which are used by the entire
<a href="http://chemistry.osu.edu/~jaroniec/">Jaroniec research group</a>.  
In addition, I designed and wrote the open source software package 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/nmrglue/">nmrglue</a>, a Python module for working with NMR data.  
My major projects as a graduate student included structural and dynamic studies of the Y145Stop 
variant of the human prion protein and development of methods for using covalently attached 
paramagnetic spin labeled to probe distances in biological solids.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.coe.edu">Coe College</a>, Cedar Rapids, Iowa</h3>
<p><b>Summer 2004</b><br />
During a research experience for undergraduates students, I synthesised and characterized alkali
vanadate glasses using plate and roller quenching techniques.</p>
